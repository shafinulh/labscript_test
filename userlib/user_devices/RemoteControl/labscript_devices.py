NOTE:

This is the file that is used by labscript to COMPILE the instructions associated with this
device. This file has NOTHING to do with the operation with the actual device. 

The only interaction this file has with is defining the structure of the instructions the
BLACS workers will later consume. It also provides a way to set Connection table and device
properties for the worker functions to also use.

we should be making these RemoteControl devices PER NEW SOFTWARE WE WANT TO SUPPORT
